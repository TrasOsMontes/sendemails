# sendemails
This python script will select a random email from a list of emails and send them every 60 minutes to the recipients set in the email.  This can help if you have a group of emails you want to send, but you don't have time to do it manually.  Make sure that your email provider allows application based email submission and that it has a a password without 2 factor authentication.
